## Geomagnetic Storm Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for exploring and analyzing geomagnetic storms using solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters, along with historical storm records.

### Project Structure
- `geomagnetic_storms/geomag_project.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
- Solar wind parameters (e.g., speed, density, temperature)
- Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) data (e.g., Bz, Bt)
- Historical geomagnetic storm records (e.g., Dst/Kp indices and event catalogs)

### Data Sources
- NASA OMNIWeb: `https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/`
- NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC): `https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/`

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2. Install Jupyter and required libraries as needed for your workflow.
3. Open the notebook:
   - From the project root, launch Jupyter and open `geomagnetic_storms/geomag_project.ipynb`.
